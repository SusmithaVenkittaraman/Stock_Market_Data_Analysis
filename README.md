# Stock_Market_Data_Analysis
  The data set consists of real-world stock market data for three consecutive years. VBA script has been written to automate the work on excel by generating yearly change, percent change, and total volume for each ticker. The VBA built is fully autonomous and can be run on all the worksheets in the workbook. The ticker having the greatest percentage change, the lowest percentage change, and the highest total volume for a particular year has been uncovered for more insights.
 
 #  Getting Started
  The repository consists of 
  1. the excel file with the macros enabled has the analysis and code alphabet_testing(test data)
  Note:: I was not able to add the multiple_year_stock_data file as it is a big data set. 
  2. Screenshots for every year on the main data (multiple year stock data) has been added.
  3. A text file with the VBA code is added.
  4. A .bas file that is expoted from the excel file and has the code as well.
  
  The project needs Microsoft Excel to run the analysis. Notepad to open the text file.
